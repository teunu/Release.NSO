# North Sawyer Overhaul Repository
North Sawyer Overhaul (NSO) is a world overhaul project for the game Stormworks. NSO aims to provide ample gameplay oppertunities, new workbenches, railways, roads and other details to the Sawyer Islands. NSO has been a main driver behind modding tools for our community as it continues development.
